**Lab 7 Revisions**

**Task 2:** When I had originally formatted the ggplot for the number of NAs in the weight column, I was struggling with the correct plot to use because I had been considering the year as a purely numerical variable in this case, and there tried using geom_line and geom_point. Once I realized that year was acting more as a categorical variable because there would never be any value at a fraction of a year, I reverted to using a bar plot. Once I got to this point, I tried switching the year to the y-axis in the aesthetics argument, but it didn't produce the horizontal bar graph desired. I assumed this was the best that could be done using ggplot because I hadn't remembered the usefulness of the coord_flip function. Until you hinted at the possibility of years being on the y-axis in my corrections, I never would have realized I could have flipped it.

**Task 1/2/3:** For the stopifnot function, I didn't understand the argument structure for the function. I assumed it was a function that reduced the need to write convoluted if statement. Therefore, I figured it would follow the same logical operator structure and require an or symbol between the arguments being tested.

The redundancy in the rescale function was a result of me assuming that since the minimum function is already defined, that I couldn't replace it with a simpler argument. I had been using the thought process of developing functions to minimize redundancy and knew I couldn't make another minimize function. This now seems obvious, but I hadn't thought at the time to just define the minimum and maximum as objects precalculated in the function. This happens a lot to me in this class, where I'll get so homed in on a specific learning target or way of doing things that I'll overcomplicated my thinking.

**Task 4:** Whenever I think of the simplest type of graph, I gravitate towards the scatterplot. This can be counterintuitive because often the purpose of the visual and the interpretation don't require a scatterplot. That happens to be the case here, where a scatterplot makes the data almost overlap and extremely hard to interpret. If there were slight changes to the data when I rescaled it, it would've been hard to see small movements in the points too. I decided to change to a boxplot because you commented we only want to see the distributions of weight, which would be shown by the quantiles of a boxplot. In general, I need to become better at answering the question in a straightforward manner.
